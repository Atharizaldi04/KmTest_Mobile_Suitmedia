# Some Note
This application was created to fulfill the Mobile Developer Internship test at Suitmedia. In this application, I used the Kotlin programming language. To fetch data from the API, I used the Retrofit library. I also implemented Shared Preferences for the user, which stores the logged-in user data and the selected user data from the data list. Since I used Shared Preferences, I added a logout button to return to the first page. That's all from me, I apologize for any shortcomings. Thank you.
